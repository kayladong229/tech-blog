# tech-blog
Completed homework for the Module 14 Challenge. The purpose was to create a blog site that allowed users to create their own account with a username and password, and then upon logging in, add their own posts and even update or delete these posts. Users can also access each individual post by clicking on the post titles at the homepage and can even leave comments under each post after doing so.
